## Status: ✅ Production Ready

This repository is fully tested, documented, and ready for npm publication.

---

## Quick Start for Publication

### 0. Install Dependencies (First Time)
```bash
npm install
```
**Note**: `node_modules` was removed before archiving to reduce size. This installs all dev dependencies.

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```
All 46 tests should pass.

### 2. Verify Package Contents
```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```
This shows exactly what will be published (no node_modules, only source and docs).

### 3. Publish to npm
```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

## Node Modules

**Q: Do I need all these files in node_modules?**

**A: YES**, but they won't be published!

- 90% are Jest and its dependencies (testing only)
- When users install with `npm install mochimo`, they only get `bs58` and `crc`
- Your `.npmignore` already excludes everything unnecessary

**Don't delete node_modules** - they're needed for:
- Running tests (`npm test`)
- Development work
- CI/CD pipelines

## Publishing Process

### Standard Publish
```bash
npm publish
```

### Dry Run (Test First)
```bash
npm publish --dry-run
```

### With Tag (Beta/Alpha)
```bash
npm publish --tag beta
```

## Notes for Engineer

1. **No changes needed** - repository is publication-ready as-is
2. **Run tests first**: `npm test` to verify everything works
3. **Check package contents**: `npm pack --dry-run` to see what will be published
4. **License is custom** - Make sure npm accepts the license string
5. **Integration test** is in `../temp-test/` (outside this repo) - provided for reference only
